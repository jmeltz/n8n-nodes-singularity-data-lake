SDL API Keys
Console API Tokens for the SDL API

Supported from Platform version Z SP5.

SentinelOne Console user API tokens now support the Singularity™ Data Lake SDL API. Console tokens are not scope-specific, and they support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), multi-Site Accounts, and multi-Account users. One SentinelOne API token can be used as the SDL API key to access all scopes available to the user.
Important

    SentinelOne Console user API tokens are not supported for the SDL API - uploadLogs SDL API, or the HTTP Event Collector (HEC) integration .

    Console User API tokens have an expiration date. For ingestion, such as the SDL API - addEvents SDL API, we recommend that you use an SDL API Log Write Access key.

    Legacy Console user API tokens generated before Platform version Z SP5 cannot be used for the Singularity™ Data Lake SDL API. You must generate a new token.

To generate a Console user API token, see Generating API tokens.

To understand the permissions required to generate a Console user API token, see Control API token generation.

To use the API token, add it where an SDL API key is required. The SDL API will execute at the scope and permission level for the user. For example, if a user has a Global, Account, or Site scope, the SDL API executes for that scope. If the user does not have the necessary RBAC permissions for an API request, the request fails.

A user with access to multiple Accounts or multiple Sites must set the S1-Scope HTTP header to execute a request for a specific scope. If this header is not given, the request does not return data. For a Site scope, the header has the form:

S1-Scope: <account scope ID>:<site scope ID>

For an Account scope, the header has the form:

S1-Scope: <account scope ID> 

You can find the Site and Account ID in the Accounts or Sites page in Policies and settings. See Managing Accounts for more details.
SDL API Keys

SDL API keys are scope-specific, and only support read or write permissions for logs or configurations. You must generate the key for a specific scope.

Select a scope from the Scope selector.
The Manage API Keys page for the XDR API

1. Open the Manage API Keys page.

In the sidebar, click Policies and settings > AI SIEM > API Keys.

There are two categories of keys:

    Log Access Keys: Log Read and Log Write keys to read and write logs.

    Configuration Access Keys. Log Read and Log Write keys to read or write configuration files.

    Key
    	

    Available APIs

    Log Read Access
    	

    Methods to read logs - query, numericQuery, facetQuery, timeseriesQuery, and powerQuery

    Log Write Access
    	

    Methods to write logs - uploadLogs and addEvents.

    Configuration Read Access
    	

    All methods available to Log Read Access, plus methods to view configuration files - getFile and listFiles.

    Configuration Write Access
    	

    All methods available to Log Read Access and Configuration Read Access, plus methods to write configuration files - putFile.

2. Select New Key Add Key to add a key. The default name is the current date, in the format "DD MM YYYY". To change the name hover on the key, and click the edit icon. You can enter a name of 20 or fewer characters. Keys are scope-sensitive. For example, if you create a Write key in a site scope and use it as the key to ingest data with the addEvents SDL API, you can only see the data in that site scope.

3. Hover on a key to Copy, Edit, Rename and Delete.
