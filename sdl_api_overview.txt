SDL API Overview

You can use the SDL API to send and retrieve log data, archive events, and manage configuration files, users, and groups.

You must generate a key to access the SDL API. There are four types. The instructions for each method show which key is required:

    Log Read Access,

    Log Write Access

    Configuration Read Access

    Configuration Write Access 

SentinelOne Console user API tokens now support the Singularity™ Data Lake SDL API. Console tokens are not scope-specific, and they support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), multi-Site Accounts, and multi-Account users. One SentinelOne API token can be used as the SDL API key to access all scopes available to the user.

Because these keys have an expiration date, we recommend a SDL API Log Write Access key for ingestion, for example with addEvents.

See SDL API Keys for more.
Available methods:

    uploadLogs: a lightweight endpoint to insert unstructured events.

    addEvents: insert structured or unstructured events.

    query: get events.

    numericQuery: get numeric / graph data (near-deprecated).

    timeseriesQuery: get numeric / graph data, for single or repetitive queries.

    facetQuery: get the most frequent values for a field.

    powerQuery: execute a PowerQuery.

    getFile: get a configuration file.

    putFile: create, update, or delete a configuration file.

    listFiles: get all configuration files.
